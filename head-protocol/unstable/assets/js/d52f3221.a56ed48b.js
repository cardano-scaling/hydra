The isomorphic nature of Hydra heads ensures that transaction validation and script execution proceed according to the same rules as on-chain, simplifying engineering and guaranteeing consistency. In case of disputes or termination, the current state of the head is decommitted back to the blockchain, updating the blockchain state to reflect the off-chain protocol evolution.
