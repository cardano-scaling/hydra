-- TODO: 'NetworkId' here is an annoying API because it requires a network magic
-- for testnet addresses. Nevertheless, the network magic is only needed for
-- Byron addresses; Shelley addresses use a different kind of network
-- discriminant which is currently fully captured as 'Mainnet | Testnet'.
--
-- So, it would be a slightly better DX to use Mainnet | Testnet as an interface
-- here since we are only constructing Shelley addresses.
