# 11. Use cardano-api

Date: 2021-11-18

## Status

Accepted

## Context

* To implement Hydra Head's ledger we have been working with the [ledger-specs](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-ledger-specs) packages which provide a low-level interface to work with transactions and ledgers
  * We also use a lightly wrapped ledger-specs API as our interface for Off-chain transaction submission. This introduced some boilerplate in order to align with cardano-api and provide JSON serialisation.
* In our initial experiments [connecting directly](./0010-use-direct-chain.md) to a cardano node we have also been using the ledger API for building transactions for want of some scripts-related features in the cardano-api
* cardano-api is expected to be the supported entrypoint for clients to interact with Cardano chain while ledger-specs is reserved for internal use and direct interactions with ledgers
* cardano-api now provides all the features we need to run our on-chain validators

## Decision

_Therefore_

* Use cardano-api types and functions instead of ledger-specs in `Hydra.Chain.Direct` component
* Use cardano-api types instead of custom ones in `Hydra.Ledger.Cardano` component

## Consequences

* Removes the boilerplate in `Hydra.Ledger.Cardano` required to map cardano-api types sent by clients to builtin and ledger-specs types
* Simplifies the  `Hydra.Chain.Direct` component:
  * Replaces custom transaction building in `Tx`
  * Replaces custom transaction fees calculation and balancing in `Wallet`
  * Replace low-level connection establishment using cardano-api functions connecting to the node (keeping the chain sync subscription)
