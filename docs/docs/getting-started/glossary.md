# Glossary

### Contestation Period
The time window between closing the head and the last time (deadline) a contest is possible by a head participant.

### Hydra Head
A running instance of the hydra head protocol. See a reference in [essential cardano](https://www.essentialcardano.io/glossary/hydra-head) for more details.

### Hydra Network
One or more hydra nodes inter-connected.

### Hydra Node
Essential building block and executable piece of software that is used to form a Hydra network.

### Isomorphic
Reuses the existing smart contract system and code for offchain computations. This guarantees that onchain and offchain semantics coincide, leading to significant engineering simplifications.

### Layer 2
Layer 2 refers to a secondary framework or protocol that is built on top of an existing blockchain system. See this [page](/core-concepts/layer-two) for more details.

### Participation Token
An on-chain token that entitles a party to participate in the Hydra head associated with the token.

### Party
A participant or logical member of a Hydra head, identified by a pair of verification keys one for the Hydra network and another one for the Cardano network.

### Peer
A member of a Hydra network, identified by an IP address and a TCP port.

### Fuel UTxO
[UTxO](https://docs.cardano.org/glossary/#utxo) pieces used to pay for Hydra head [transaction](https://docs.cardano.org/glossary/#transaction) [fees](https://docs.cardano.org/glossary/#fee) happening on the base layer (i.e. the Cardano network).

### Reference script
See this [page](./quickstart#reference-scripts) for more details.

### Rollback
The manifestation of a chain switch on the base layer, causing the recent history to change. It is a multi-step process between the head and L1. See this [page](/core-concepts/rollbacks) for more details.

### Signing key
See a reference in [cardano glossary](https://docs.cardano.org/glossary/#keypair) for more details.

### Snapshot
Some state of a Hydra head; When multi-signed by all parties, a snapshot is said "confirmed".

### State Channel
A common kind of layer two solution. See this [page](/core-concepts/layer-two#state-channels) for more details.

### State Thread Token
An on-chain token representing the state of a Hydra head.

### Verification Key
See a reference in [cardano glossary](https://docs.cardano.org/glossary/#keypair) for more details.
