# Operate a Hydra node

```mdx-code-block
import TerminalWindow from '@site/src/components/TerminalWindow';
```

This page guides Hydra users on troubleshooting issues when running their instances of `hydra-node` and participating in a Hydra head.

## Example setup

We offer sample node configurations that will help you get started with hosting a Hydra node on virtual machines in the cloud. These configurations are available in the [`sample-node-config/` directory](https://github.com/cardano-scaling/hydra/tree/master/sample-node-config/).


### Google Cloud with Terraform

This setup includes a [docker-compose.yaml](https://github.com/cardano-scaling/hydra/blob/master/sample-node-config/gcp/docker-compose.yaml) file, which serves as a robust template for configuring `cardano-node` and `hydra-node` services. Also, various scripts are provided to help you set up your cluster.

## Logs

Following the principles outlined in [ADR-9](/adr/9), the `hydra-node` emits [JSON](https://json.org) formatted logs to the `stdout` stream, with one log item per line. These log entries conform to a specific [JSON schema](https://github.com/cardano-scaling/hydra/blob/master/hydra-node/json-schemas/logs.yaml). We deliberately maintain the logging mechanism simple and non-configurable to facilitate the integration of Hydra logs into broader log analysis infrastructures, including custom ELK stacks, third-party services, or Docker sidecars.

## Monitoring

When the `--monitoring-port PORT` argument is provided, the `hydra-node` executable will expose a [Prometheus](https://prometheus.io) compatible HTTP `/metrics` endpoint on the specified port to enable metrics scraping.

For instance, if a `hydra-node` is initiated with `--monitoring-port 6001`, the following command:


```mdx-code-block
<TerminalWindow>
curl http://localhost:6001/metrics
</TerminalWindow>
```

will output:

```
# TYPE hydra_head_confirmed_tx counter
hydra_head_confirmed_tx  0
# TYPE hydra_head_inputs counter
hydra_head_inputs  50467
# TYPE hydra_head_requested_tx counter

# TYPE hydra_head_tx_confirmation_time_ms histogram

```

## Common issues

### No head is observed from the chain

* Ensure the `hydra-node` is connected to a `cardano-node` operating on the correct network. Verify the `--network` command-line argument and the `cardano-node` configuration.
* Remember, the `hydra-node` cannot start if it cannot connect to the `cardano-node`, which might require time as the `cardano-node` must revalidate its database and potentially reconstruct its ledger state upon startup. Its connections are not open until it is fully prepared. If running as a service or a container, ensure that the orchestrator restarts the process when it crashes.
* Check that the _Scripts_ transaction identifier is valid. This identifier is provided on the [release](https://github.com/cardano-scaling/hydra/releases/tag/0.10.0) page for the three major networks (`preview`, `pre-production`, `mainnet`).
* Verify that the `hydra-node`'s _Cardano signing key_ is consistent with the _Verification key_ from the `Init` transaction. Ensure the `--cardano-signing-key` parameter points to the correct key, and that peers have the accurate `--cardano-verification-key` for your node.
* Confirm that peers' _Cardano verification keys_ are accurate. This mirrors the above issue; check parameters on all peers.

### Head does not make progress

* Confirm peers are properly connected to each other. Verify the `--peer` arguments point to the correct `host:port` for each peer. The `PeerConnected` message should be observed by the client or appear in the logs and be consistent across all peers involved in a head.
* Ensure the _Hydra signing key_ for your node or the _Hydra verification keys_ for peers match each node's expectations. Verify that `AckSn` messages are received by all parties and that the `LogicOutcome` log contains no errors.

### Head Stuck: Peer Out of Sync

Processing transactions in a Hydra head requires each node to agree on transactions, which occurs when they sign a snapshot during the AckSn phase. The protocol validates transactions (on the NewTx command) against its local view of the ledger state, using the provided --ledger-protocol-parameters. Since transaction validity depends on configuration (and, to some extent, the exact build versions of hydra-node), one node may accept a transaction while its peers reject it.

When this happens, the accepting node's local state diverges from the rest, potentially leading to attempts to spend outputs that other nodes do not recognize as available.

This issue can also arise if a peer goes offline while a transaction is submitted, potentially causing the Hydra head to become stuck and preventing further snapshots from being signed ([see test case](https://github.com/cardano-scaling/hydra/pull/1780)).

As a result of this divergence, the local ledger state of each Hydra node essentially becomes forked, resulting in inconsistent states across the network. While it is technically still possible to submit transactions to the Hydra nodes, doing so is ineffective because snapshots do not update unless all nodes sign them. Each node starts accepting transactions based on entirely different states, leading to disagreement on which UTxOs have been spent.

To recover from this issue, we introduced side-loading of snapshots to synchronize the local ledger state of the Hydra nodes. With this mechanism, every peer reverts to the latest confirmed snapshot. This can be done by using latest snapshot confirmed from GET /snapshot to call the POST /snapshot endpoint, which clears the peerâ€™s local pending transactions and restores its state to match the last agreed snapshot, allowing the node to rejoin the consensus with the rest of the network.

Newer confirmed snapshots can also be adopted if all party members use the POST /snapshot endpoint with the same ConfirmedSnapshot as the JSON body.

It is important to note that this recovery process is a coordinated effort among peers to ensure the consistency and availability of the Hydra head.
