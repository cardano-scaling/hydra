# About Hydra

If you've read the [user manual](../index.md) and want to learn more about the Hydra protocol, its inner workings, and its implementation, you're in the right place.

The developer documentation provides detailed materials that move beyond just _using_ Hydra to _understanding_ it. This section is for anyone looking to gain a comprehensive understanding of the Hydra protocol, including protocol architects interested in developing their own variants and developers contributing to the [reference implementation](https://github.com/input-output-hk/hydra) of Hydra.

The following sections are more technical and may be less cohesive than the user manual. However, the [architecture](./architecture) and the [specification](./specification) sections are good starting points.
