# Haskell packages

The Hydra project consists of several Haskell packages, each serving distinct parts of the protocol. While some packages are internal and tailored specifically to Hydra, others offer more generic functionalities that could benefit other projects tackling similar challenges. Comprehensive [Haddock](https://www.haskell.org/haddock/) documentation is provided for all packages.
