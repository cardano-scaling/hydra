# Hydra for payments

:::caution This category will be restructured

The payments category will undergo a restructuring to focus more coherently on use-case-centric roadmaps of application scenarios. Currently, it includes some legacy use case articles.
:::

Hydra for payments represents a collaborative effort with Obsidian Systems aimed at enhancing the Hydra head protocol with specialized tooling designed for payment-specific use cases.

The ongoing development phase concentrates on expanding the existing open-source Hydra for payments library by incorporating the following enhancements:

- An improved **payment channel API** that includes convenience features to reduce ramp-up time and accelerate market readiness for developers.
  
- Enhanced high-assurance mechanisms, which are crucial for developers of commercial projects that manage user assets.
  
- Versatile **configurations** equipped with sensible defaults to aid developers in dynamically scaling their products and crafting engaging user experiences.

The culmination of this phase will see the integration of these developments into the **mainnet-compatible Hydra for payments SDK**.

To validate these enhancements, we plan to launch a **mobile reference application**. This application will directly leverage the Hydra for payments SDK, incorporating all essential payment channel functionalities.
