-- | An implementation of a Merkle-Patricia tree, with additions and deletions
-- of elements from root hashes.
--
-- Note that this module is not meant to be used as a handful data-structures
-- for classic operations; Those operations are better done with a `Map` or a
-- `HashMap` containers. A 'MerklePatriciaTree' can however be leveraged to
-- produce proofs which sizes are logarithmic in the size of the tree, and which
-- can be verified using only a root hash. This makes is feasible to embed
-- verifiable operations on an existing tree with only tiny proofs.

--
-- Let's now consider the proof for the key '00100110':
--
-- - (ø, [(1,fa61b)])
-- - (ø, [(1,38e90)])
-- - (100110, [])
--
-- At each level (visible through indentation), the proof contains the common
-- prefix for that level, as well as the _other_ children needed to reconstruct
-- the hash. We need therefore to reconstruct the proof from the _end_, and to
-- go up one level at the time until we reach the root. Note however that we
-- calculate __two hashes__ at the same time:
--
-- - The resulting root hash reconstructed from the proof, with the element.
-- - The resulting root hash reconstructed from the proof, _without the element_.
--
-- Both results are useful to determine whether a modification (addition /
-- deletion) in the tree is legal.
--
-- The first part of the proof being considered is (100110, []) which
-- represents the leaf and the suffix of the reference (or the leaf's prefix).
-- There's no children and no value, because the value is provided by the caller
-- for verification. From there, we can easily calculate the resulting leaf hash
-- by re-hashing the value and the corresponding part of the suffix and then go
-- recursively through each node levels above, in reverse order.
--
-- The next one is (ø, [(1,38e90)]) which indeed correspond to the _other_branch
-- once we have consumed '100110' from the end of the reference. The path to the
-- element is on the branch `0`, thus we need the branch `1` to continue the
-- proof.
--
-- This is also where it gets interesting. Calculating the root hash for
-- the sub-MPT _with_ the element is trivial. We can re-construct the hash for the
-- branch on our path, and the proof contains the hash of the other branch.
-- Calculating the hash of the sub-MPT _without_ the element is more complex
-- because, the structure of the tree changes. When the element is present, we
-- have a Node with no prefix, and two branches on '0' and '1'. When the element
-- is not present, we have a leaf, with '1000110' as prefix.
--
-- What is perhaps taken for granted at the moment (and quite convenient you'll
-- admit!) is that, the hash of the Leaf with prefix 1000110 and the hash of the
-- node from the branch '1' with a single leaf with prefix 000110 are actually
-- the same!
-- This is done _by construction_ to make it possible to reconstruct hashes even
-- if the structure of the tree changes! For more details, see the doc-string on
-- the 'hashPrefix' function, but in short: a prefix is hashed in multiple rounds,
-- one hash per bit, all nested. Such that it's easy to add or peel a layer
-- from the oignon-hash. To get a sense of this, imagine for a moment that this
-- wasn't the case, and that the hash of the leaf would be different than the
-- hash of a node with leaf... how would you reconstruct the hash of the MPT
-- with the target element removed? When constructed "naively", we would typically
-- construct the node hash as:
--
--        *--- Node's prefix
--        v
--   hash(ø|hash(000110|hash(value)))
--                 ^
--                 *--- Leaf's prefix
--
-- But now, to reconstruct the tree _without_ the element, we would need to
-- construct (still naively) the hash as:
--
--           *--- Leaf's prefix
--           v
--   hash(1000110|hash(value))
--
-- We don't have hash(value) in the proof, and we don't really have a way to get
-- from the former to the latter. So, the trick in the construction of the tree
-- and all the hashes is to (a) include the branch bit in the hash and (b) hash
-- every bit separately, in an oignon pattern such that, the proof has
-- actually the following shape:
--
--   hash(1|hash(0|hash(0|hash(0|hash(1|hash(1|hash(0|hash(value))))))))
--
-- And now, it becomes trivial to move forward since, with both representation,
-- hashes become equal and we can easily add new layers on top if needed. As
-- this is the case for the _next_ node. The first node is easy to re-calculate
-- because, it is transformed into a leaf in the absence of the proved element.
--
-- Then, the next (and last) part of the proof is indeed (ø, [(1,38e90)]). The
-- case where the element is present is trivial. When it's absent however, we
-- need to calculate the hash of the '0' branch, which is straightforward with
-- the way we construct hashes:
--
--    hash(0|prev_hash)  *where prev_hash is the hash we calculated just above.
--
-- This wouldn't be possible with a naive hash construction, but is rendered
-- easy by hashing each bit separately. Doing this recursively up to the top
-- yields two root hashes which can then be used for membership verification,
-- addition or deletion.

-- one hash per character in the prefix and is necessary for the `add` and

-- zero or vice-versa), it is important to construct root hashes in a way which
-- does not assume in which order the prefix is constructed.
--
-- That is, for a given prefix `xyz` and a value `V`, the resulting hash is:
--
--     h (x | h (y | h (z | h(V))))
--
-- and not:
--
--     h (xyz | h(V))
--
-- Doing this makes it possible to add or remove neighbor elements from the
-- tree while still allowing to re-computing hashes as necessary. As an obvious
-- downside, inserting any element with references of size `n` requires exactly
-- `n` hashes __per element__
