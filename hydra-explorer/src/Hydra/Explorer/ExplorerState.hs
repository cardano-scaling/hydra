-- | Represents the external appearance of a head state.
--
-- The decision to observe certain attributes or not is designed to address situations
-- where the explorer observes a head transaction on the chain without its
-- previously expected observation, preventing the loss of information during the transition.
-- Additionally, this simplifies the API for clients, eliminating the need to match against
-- different states.
