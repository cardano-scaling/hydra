= Security (WIP - Iteration 1) <sec:security>
#todo[The security analysis is still *sketchy*, with the goal to make it more formal in upcoming iterations]

#todo[Add security experiment]
Adversaries:

/ Active Adversary.: An _active adversary_ $adv$ has full control
  over the protocol, i.e., he is fully unrestricted in the above#todo[above this section there is no security game] security game.

/ Network Adversary.: A _network adversary_ $adv_emptyset$ does not corrupt
  any head parties, eventually delivers all sent network messages
  (i.e., does not drop any messages), and does not cause the $hpClose$ event.
  Apart from this restriction, the adversary can act arbitrarily in the above experiment.

Random variables:

- $That_i$: the set of transactions $tx$ for which party $party_i$,
  _while uncorrupted_, output $(hpSeen, tx)$;

- $Tbar_i$: the set of transactions $tx$ for which party $party_i$,
  _while uncorrupted_, output $(hpConf, tx)$;

- $Snapbar_i$: latest snapshot $(s, U)$ that party
  $party_i$ performed _while uncorrupted_: output $(hpSnap, (s, U))$;

- $Hcont$: the set of (at the time) uncorrupted parties who produced
  $xi$ upon close/contest request and $xi$ was applied to
  correct~$eta$; and

- $honest$: the set of parties that remain uncorrupted.


Security conditions / events:

- #propName[Consistency (Head)]: In presence of an active adversary, the
  following condition holds at any point in time:
  For all $i, j$,
  $Uinit compose (Tbar_i union Tbar_j) != bot$, i.e., no two
  uncorrupted parties see conflicting transactions confirmed.

- #propName[Oblivious Liveness (Head)]:
  Consider any protocol execution in presence of a network adversary wherein
  the head does not get closed for a sufficiently long period of time, and consider
  an honest party $p_i$ who enters transaction $tx$ by executing $(hpNew, tx)$ _each time after having finished a snapshot_.

  Then the following eventually holds:
  $tx in inter.big_(i in [n]) Tbar_i or
  forall i: Uinit compose (Tbar_i union {tx}) = bot$,
  i.e., every party will observe the transaction confirmed or every party
  will observe the transaction in conflict with their confirmed transactions.#footnote[
    In particular, _liveness_ expresses that the protocol makes progress
    under reasonable network conditions if no head parties get corrupted.
  ]

- #propName[Soundness (Chain)]: In presence of an active adversary,
  the following condition is satisfied:
  $exists Ttilde subset.eq inter.big_(i in honest) That_i : Ufinal
  = Uinit compose Ttilde != bot$, i.e., the final UTxO set results
  from applying a set of transactions to $U_0$ that have been seen by
  all honest parties (whereas each such transaction applies conforming to the ledger rules).

- #propName[Completeness (Chain)]: In presence of an active adversary,
  the following condition holds: For $Ttilde$ as above,
  $union.big_(p_i in Hcont) Tbar_i subset.eq Ttilde$, i.e., all
  transactions seen as confirmed by an honest party at the end of the
  protocol are considered.

Note that the original version of the coordinated head satisfies a stronger version of liveness which is important for the 'user experience' in the protocol:

- #propName[Liveness (Head)]:
  Consider any protocol execution in presence of a network adversary wherein
  the head does not get closed for a sufficiently long period of time, and consider
  an honest party $p_i$ who enters transaction $tx$ by executing $(hpNew, tx)$.

  Then the following eventually holds:
  $tx in inter.big_(i in [n]) Tbar_i or
  forall i: Uinit compose (Tbar_i union {tx}) = bot$,
  i.e., every party will observe the transaction confirmed or every party
  will observe the transaction in conflict with their confirmed transactions.#footnote[
    In particular, _liveness_ expresses that the protocol makes progress
    under reasonable network conditions if no head parties get corrupted.
  ]


== Proofs

The security properties are stated over the protocol model below. Three of the four are
*machine-checked* in Agda - #propName[Consistency] (`consistency`), #propName[Soundness]
(`soundness`) and #propName[Completeness] (`completeness`) - with the safety content *derived*
from a signature model (below): individual party signatures, a snapshot _confirmable_ only once
*every* party signed it (the coordinated head's full multisignature), and honest parties signing
only _applicable_ snapshots, at most one per number, each extending the signer's own confirmed
snapshot. From these the Agda machine-checks that every honest party's confirmed snapshot is
applicable to $Uinit$ (so confirmed sets never conflict), that two confirmations of the same snapshot
number coincide, and that confirmed snapshots nest by number (`confirmed-nest`).
`confirm` checks the §3.2 aggregate multisignature (`msVfy`); `msgOf` is the snapshot's
own serialised content (`snapMsg` of its version, number and η-hash), so the verified message depends
only on the snapshot's identifying fields rather than being a free token. The binding of a verifying
signature to a snapshot is formally carried by `ms-unforgeable`. These are theorems about every
#emph[currently]-honest party's confirmed snapshot (the random variables $That_i$/$Tbar_i$ are scoped
to a party _while uncorrupted_; corruption only shrinks the honest set, and the theorems do not
constrain a once-honest-now-corrupt party's confirmed set). The safety perimeter - the assumptions
the proofs rest on - is: (a) the ledger semantics (`applyTxs`); (b) per-signature _unforgeability_
(`sigUnforge`, EUF-CMA) plus the aggregation scheme's n-of-n decomposition (`aggSound`), from which
the aggregate-level `ms-unforgeable` is *derived*; (c) the honest-signing
discipline baked into `signHonest` (sign only applicable,
≤1 per number, extend own confirmed) - an explicit honest-_behaviour_ assumption from §6.2,
not derived from the off-chain handlers; and (d) for the on-chain bridge only, that the finalized
datum's stored accumulator commits to the off-chain final UTxO (the `ηEq` hypothesis of `reflects`,
supplied per finalization), irreducible because νHead authenticates η via the multisignature, not by
recomputing it. The verified aggregate is SYSTEM-RELATIVE (`AggVerified sys snap` checks the
aggregate `aggSigOf sys snap` built from `sigs sys`), which keeps the confirmation layer
non-vacuous: tying it to the signing system's recorded signatures makes `AggVerified sys snap`
correctly false where the signatures are absent yet satisfiable where every party signed, so a model
with genuine confirmations exists. #propName[Liveness] remains a postulate pending the
temporal/fairness layer (P3). The prose lemmas
further below give the informal arguments these proofs mirror.

#dparagraph[Scope (what these proofs do and do not cover).] To avoid over-reading the word "unified":
these §7 proofs and the on-chain validity bundles of @sec:on-chain (`closeValid`, `incrementValid`, …)
are *two distinct formalizations that meet only at datum-field accessors*. The security model reads the
on-chain datum only through `OC.snapNum`/`OC.ηOf`/`OC.accUTxO`; the `finalize` step admits *any*
datum with a matching snapshot number, so no safety theorem ever consumes a bundle's value-conservation,
deadline, signature or contester checks. Those bundles are instead cross-checked against the real Plutus
validator by the extracted differential oracle (the `Reference`/`ReferenceBridge` modules),
not by these theorems. Two further honesty notes: (i) *non-vacuity* (that some confirmation is reachable) is a
meta-level model-existence argument, not machine-checked, because `msVfy` is an abstract postulate so no
closed term proves `AggVerified`; (ii) the `ηEq` accumulator-commitment is supplied by the finalizer, not
enforced by the model, so `Reflects` is conditional on the finalizer having posted the η it signed. The
νDeposit validator (`deposit.ak`) and the off-chain handlers are likewise hand-reviewed coverage
boundaries (see `claimTxValid`), not part of any machine-checked theorem here.

```agda
-- An illustrative standalone proposition (not part of the proved properties below): a
-- confirmed snapshot's number does not decrease from one local state to another.
SnapshotMonotone : LocalState → LocalState → Set
SnapshotMonotone st st' =
  Snapshot.number (LocalState.confirmed st) ≤ Snapshot.number (LocalState.confirmed st')
```

The §7 properties quantify over whole multi-party executions in the presence of an
adversary, so they are stated over an explicit execution model: a ledger-application operation `applyTxs`, a global
$sans("System")$ state recording each party's signatures, a concrete single-step relation
$sans("_⟶ˢ_")$ (an honest party signs an _applicable_ snapshot; a corrupt party signs arbitrarily;
a party confirms a snapshot whose aggregate multisignature verifies; the adversary corrupts a party),
and the $sans("Reachable")$ closure from an initial system. A snapshot is $sans("Certified")$ once
*every* party signed it, so
unforgeability is immediate: a certified snapshot carries the confirmer's own honest signature. The
machine-checked invariant then *derives*: (i) every honest party's confirmed snapshot is applicable
to $Uinit$, from the honest "sign only applicable" guard; (ii) two certified snapshots of the same
number are equal, from the honest "one signature per number" guard; and (iii) confirmed snapshots
nest by number (`confirmed-nest`), from the honest "extend my own confirmed snapshot" guard plus a
gap induction using (ii). `confirm` checks the §3.2 aggregate multisignature (`AggVerified`/`msVfy`).
Beyond the ledger `applyTxs` and the scheme's unforgeability (per-signature `sigUnforge` + the
`aggSound` decomposition, from which `ms-unforgeable` is derived), the safety argument
relies on the honest-_behaviour_ assumption encoded in `signHonest` (see the modelling note below;
it is what makes the confirmed chain linear and monotone, and is not derived from the off-chain
handlers) and, for the on-chain side, on the finalization bridge's accumulator-commitment hypothesis.
The off-chain⇒on-chain link is CONSTRUCTED (`reflects`, from a `finalize` step): the
conflict-freedom and snapshot-number conjuncts of `Reflects` are derived, leaving the stored
accumulator's commitment to the off-chain UTxO as the single assumed conjunct, supplied per
finalization as the explicit hypothesis `ηEq` (a hypothesis, not a global axiom, since `finalize`
admits any matching-number datum). *Liveness* additionally needs a
temporal/fairness layer (P3).

This section states the model and the property statements; the machine-checked *proof terms* (the
`invariant` and its L1/L2/L3 corollaries, the `consistency`/`soundness`/`completeness` derivations, the
once-honest-then-corrupt extension and the `reflects` bridge) live in the companion module
#raw("Hydra.Protocol.SecurityProofs") so the prose stays focused on the statements. They are still
checked by `nix build` (imported by `Main`), so the properties remain machine-verified.

#dparagraph[Modelling note (honest signing discipline, derived).]
The `signHonest` move is DRIVEN by the off-chain handler model: an honest party signs by FIRING the
`reqSn-sign` handler (OffChain `_handles_↝_`) with no snapshot in flight ($hats = bars$). From these
operational inputs the four honest-signing guards are PROVED, not assumed: it signs the snapshot
numbered exactly one above its _own_ confirmed snapshot (the handler's $s = bars + 1$, with $hats = bars$),
whose transactions extend that snapshot's by an applicable observed delta, and signs at most one snapshot
per number (because signing advances $hats$, so the invariant `signNumBound` bounds every prior signature
strictly below the new number). Applicability to $Uinit$ follows by ledger compositionality
(`applyTxs-compose`) from the party's confirmed-applicability invariant; only-seen follows from the
delta-observed input and the `sigSeen` invariant. The §6 prose specifies this regime operationally
(round-robin snapshot leader, $s = hats + 1$, the $hpRS$ 'wait' guards); the security model derives
its safety consequences from a faithful transcription of that handler. It is
what makes the confirmed chain provably linear (`agree`) and monotone (`confirmed-nest`).

#dparagraph[Consistency.]

#lemma(name: [Consistency])[
  The coordinated head protocol satisfies the #propName[Consistency] property.
] <lem:consistency>
#proof[
  Observe that $Tbar_i union Tbar_j subset.eq That_i$ since no
  transaction can be confirmed without every honest party signing off
  on it. Since parties do not sign conflicting transactions
  (see $hpRS$, 'wait'), we have
  $Uinit applytx Tbar_i != bot$,
  $Uinit applytx Tbar_j != bot$, and
  $Uinit applytx That_i != bot$. Thus, since $Tbar_i union Tbar_j subset.eq That_i$
  it follows that
  $Uinit applytx (Tbar_i union Tbar_j) != bot$

  _Machine-checked as `consistency` (above), *derived* from the signature model: each honest
  party's confirmed set is applicable (`conf-applicable`: a confirmed snapshot is certified, so it
  carries that party's own signature, and honest parties sign only applicable snapshots), and the two
  confirmed sets nest (`confirmed-nest`, derived via `cert-nest` from the honest extend-your-own-confirmed
  guard + agreement). The only safety assumptions are the ledger and the §3.2 multisignature's
  unforgeability (`ms-unforgeable`). The statement also covers parties corrupted AFTER
  confirming (`consistency-uncorrupted`): since `confirm` requires a multisignature regardless of the
  confirmer's honesty, EVERY confirmed snapshot is certified (`confCert-all`), so any party's confirmed
  set -- including a once-honest party's, the one an on-chain close could be built against -- stays
  consistent with every other's, given at least one honest party._

#dparagraph[Oblivious Liveness.]
For all lemmas towards oblivious liveness, we assume the presence of a network adversary, and that the head does not get closed for a sufficiently
long period of time.
We call this the _liveness condition_.

#lemma[
  Under the liveness condition, any snapshot issued as $(hpRS, s, T)$ will eventually be confirmed
  in the sense that every party holds a valid mulisignature on it.
] <lem:reqconf>
#proof[
  Consider a party $p_i$ receiving message $(hpRS, s, T)$. We demonstrate that $p_i$ executes
  the code past the 'wait' instruction of the $hpRS$ routine.

  - Passing the 'require' guard:
  Note that the snapshot leader sends the request only if $hats = bars$, and for $s = hats + 1$.
  Thus, $hats_i = hats$ since $p_i$ has already signed the snapshot for $hats$. The 'require'
  guard is thus satisfied for $p_i$.

  - Passing the 'wait' guard:
  Since the snapshot leader sees $hats = bars$, also $p_i$ will eventually see $hats_i = bars_i$. Furthermore, since all leaders are honest, it holds that $hatmU applytx mT_("res") != bot$ by construction.

  This implies that every party will eventually sign and acknowledge the newly created snapshot.
  Finally, the 'require' and 'wait' guards of the $hpAS$ code will be passed by every party
  since an $hpAS$ for snapshot number $s$ can only be received for $s in {hats, hats + 1}$
  as an acknowledgement can only be received for the current snapshot being worked on by $p_i$
  or a snapshot that is one step ahead - implying that everybody will hold a valid multisignature
  on the snapshot in consideration.
]

#lemma(name: [Eternal snapshot confirmation])[
  Under the liveness condition, as long as new transactions are issued, for any $k > 0$, every party eventually confirms
  a snapshot with sequence number $s = k$.
] <lem:eternal>
#proof[
  By @lem:reqconf, any requested snapshot eventually gets confirmed, implying
  that the next leader observes $hats = bars$ and thus, in turn, issues a new snapshot.
  Thus, for any $k$, a snapshot is eventually confirmed.
]

#lemma(name: [Oblivious Liveness])[
  The coordinated head protocol satisfies the #propName[Oblivious Liveness] property.
] <lem:liveness>
#proof[
  Consider the first point in time where a transaction $tx$ enters the system by some party $p_i$
  issuing $(hpNew, tx)$, and consider the next point in time
  $t$ when $p_i$ issues a snapshot.

  By @lem:eternal, this snapshot will eventually be issued and confirmed by all parties.

  #v(0.5em)

  Let $hatmT$ be the transactions to be considered by $p_i$'s snapshot: $hatmL = barmU applytx hatmT$
  where $barmU$ is the snapshot prior to $p_i$'s. Since $p_i$ issues
  $(hpRT, tx)$ after each snapshot, we have that, either,
  - $tx in hatmT$, in which case $tx in inter.big_(i in [n]) Tbar_i$ after everybody has completed this snapshot, or,
  - $tx in.not hatmT$, in which case $hatmL applytx tx = bot$ ($tx$ is still in the wait queue of $(hpRT, tx)$. After everybody has completed this snapshot, it thus holds that $forall i: Uinit applytx Tbar_i = hatmL$, and thus, that
    $forall i: Uinit applytx (Tbar_i union {tx}) = bot$.
  In both cases, the lemma follows.
]

#dparagraph[Soundness and completeness.]

#lemma(name: [Soundness])[
  The basic head protocol satisfies the #propName[Soundness] property.
] <lem:soundness>

#proof[
  Let $T$ be the set of transactions such that $Ufinal = U_0 applytx T$.
  Since $Ufinal$ is multi-signed, it holds that $T subset.eq That_i$
  ($T$ is _seen_) by every honest party in the head.
  Furthermore, since honest signatures are only issued for valid transaction,
  $Ufinal != bot$ (i.e., $Ufinal$ is a valid state), and soundness
  follows.

  _Machine-checked as #raw("soundness") above ($Ufinal = U_0 applytx tilde(T) != bot$ with
  $tilde(T)$ the certified finalized snapshot). The $!= bot$ is *derived*: a
  certified snapshot carries an honest party's signature, and honest parties sign only applicable
  snapshots (`cert-applicable`). The $tilde(T) subset.eq inter.big_(i in honest) That_i$ conjunct
  is machine-checked too: an honest party signs only transactions it has observed (the `signHonest`
  seen guard), so a certified snapshot's transactions lie in every honest party's seen set
  (`sigSeen-inv`), proved as the second conjunct of #raw("soundness")._
]


#lemma(name: [Completeness])[
  The basic head protocol satisfies the #propName[Completeness]
  property.
] <lem:completeness>
#proof[
  Consider all parties $p_i in Hcont$. Since the close/contest process
  finally accepts the latest multi-signed snapshot, it holds that
  $Ufinal . s >= max_(p_i in Hcont) (bars_i)$, and thus that
  $union.big_(p_i in Hcont) Tbar_i subset.eq inter.big_(p_i in honest) That_i$,
  and completeness follows.

  _Machine-checked as #raw("completeness") above (each honest party's $Tbar_i subset.eq tilde(T)$
  whenever $bars_i <= s_f$). This is the snapshot-nesting property `confirmed-nest` (L2), *derived*
  (`cert-nest`)._
