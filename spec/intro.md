# Introduction

This document specifies the 'Coordinated Hydra Head' protocol to be
implemented as the first version of Hydra Head on Cardano - **Hydra
HeadV1**. The protocol is derived from variants described in the
original paper [@hydrahead20], but was further simplified to make a
first implementation on Cardano possible.

Note that the format and scope of this document is (currently) also
inspired by the paper and hence does not include a definition of the
networking protocols or concrete message formats. It is structured
similarly, but focuses on a single variant, and avoids indirections and
unnecessary generalizations. The document is kept in sync with the
reference implementation available on GithubÂ [@hydra-repo].

$\red{Red}$ sections indicate that they are currently not
covered or missing in the implementation, where
$\blue{blue}$ parts mean a difference in how it is
realized.

First, a high-level overview of the protocol and how it differs from legacy
variants of the Head protocol is given in section [Overview](#sec:overview).
Relevant definitions and notations are introduced in [Preliminaries](#sec:prel),
while section [Setup](#sec:setup) describes protocol setup and assumptions.
Then, the actual on-chain transactions of the protocol are defined in
[On-chain](#sec:on-chain), before the off-chain protocol part specifies behavior
of Hydra parties off-chain and ties the knot with on-chain transactions in
[Off-chain](#sec:offchain). At last, [Security](#sec:security) gives the
security definition, properties and proofs for the Coordinated Head protocol.
