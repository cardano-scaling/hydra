# Hydra Cluster Tool

This package contains the same-named `hydra-cluster` executable, which provides
some tools to work with a "cluster" of Hydra nodes running on top of a Cardano
network:
* It can be used for "smoke testing" the `hydra-node` against an
  existing, well-known Cardano network (eg. `preprod` or `preview`
  testnets),
* It can be used to spin-up a "development" Cardano network made up of a single
  cardano-node, with Hydra validators published in a transaction.

## Requirements

The `hydra-cluster` works by spawning processes running the required
executables, namely `hydra-node` and `cardano-node`, which therefore
must be in scope. You could use a special nix shell containing
`hydra-node` and `hydra-cluster` executables:

```sh
nix develop .#exes
```

Or use an alias:

```sh
cabal build hydra-node
alias hydra-node=$(cabal exec which -- hydra-node)
```

The `HYDRA_CONFIG_DIR` environment variable is used to control where the executable will look
for its configuration files. By default those files are resolved using the cabal package's
data structure which is not always convenient.

## Smoke Testing

The `hydra-cluster` executable spins up a `cardano-node` as a network
participant which synchronizes the block chain and then executes a
single scenario (single party, full life cycle) using funds available
to the `config/credentials/faucet.sk` on that network. The Hydra nodes
can reference pre-existing contracts living at some well-known
transaction or can post a new transaction to use those contracts.

:warning: do not provide actual funds to this faucet address as the
signing key is publicly available. Shall you want to run the smoke
test with actual funds, you shall override these file to use a secret
signing key safely stored. See how the C.I overrides these files in
.github/workflows/smoke-test.yaml

To run the smoke test against the official cardano testnet using a
local `state-testnet` directory (to re-use the synchronized chain db):

Note: To get the transaction id for `--hydra-scripts-tx-id` parameter you can
consult our [release page](https://github.com/cardano-scaling/hydra/releases)
where you can find pre-published Hydra scripts for different networks.

```sh
hydra-cluster --preview --state-directory state-testnet --hydra-scripts-tx-id <tx-id>
```

> Note: If you want to do it on mainnet
> ```sh
> hydra-cluster --mainnet --state-directory state-mainnet --hydra-scripts-tx-id <tx-id>
> ```

:warning: the C.I. overrides these files for mainnet. On the C.I. the
faucet secrets are base64 encoded. Shall you need to update them, you
could do it with the following commands (if you're not sure, do not
do this, you may loose access to faucet funds):

```sh
#> cat faucet.vk | base64 | gh secret set faucet_vk
#> cat faucet.sk | base64 | gh secret set faucet_sk
```

## Local devnet

`hydra-cluster` can run a local cardano devnet in the form of a single
block producer with a faster production rate than normal. This is useful in situations where
one wants to test Hydra-based DApps, eg. applications and services using Hydra.

Running the following command in the toplevel directory:

```sh
HYDRA_CONFIG_DIR=hydra-cluster/config hydra-cluster --devnet --state-directory test --publish-hydra-scripts
```

will result in a cardano-node running its own network, yielding the following UTxO

```
% CARDANO_NODE_SOCKET_PATH=test/node.socket cardano-cli query utxo --testnet-magic 42 --whole-utxo
                           TxHash                                 TxIx        Amount

```

Adding ` --publish-hydra-scripts` argument will ensure Hydra validator scripts are published
on the network and available as reference inputs for hydra-node.

# Test suite

The `hydra-cluster:test:integration` test suite runs multiple scenarios on a
local cluster of `hydra-node`s connected to a local Cardano "devnet".

This "devnet" is a trivial Cardano network comprised by only a single block
producing node, having all the stake. This is of course not exactly how a proper
Cardano network would work, but the scope of this package and it's tests are to
assert correct hydra-node behavior in a cluster of Hydra nodes.

Run the integration test suite with `cabal test`

# Benchmarks

The benchmark can be run using `cabal bench` and produces a
`results.csv` file in a work directory. To plot the transaction
confirmation times you can use the `bench/plot.sh` script, passing it
the directory containing the benchmark's results.

To run and plot results of the benchmark:

```sh
$ cabal bench --benchmark-options 'single'
Running 1 benchmarks...
Benchmark bench-e2e: RUNNING...
Writing transactions to: /run/user/1000/bench-83d18973f95a554d/txs.json
[...]
Writing results to: /run/user/1000/bench-6b772589d08f82a5/results.csv
Benchmark bench-e2e: FINISH
$ bench/plot.sh /run/user/1000/bench-6b772589d08f82a5
Created plot: /run/user/1000/bench-6b772589d08f82a5/results.png
```

Note that if it's present in the environment, benchnark executable will gather basic system-level statistics about the RAM, CPU, and network bandwidth used. The `plot.sh` script then displays those alongside tx confirmation time in a single graph.

The benchmark can be run in two modes corresponding to two different commands:

* `single`: Runs a single _dataset_ either freshly generated in some temporary directory or pre-existing. This is useful to either generate data or to run experiments.
* `datasets`: Runs one or more preexisting _datasets_ in sequence and collect their results in a single markdown formatted file. This is useful to track the evolution of hydra-node's performance over some well-known datasets over time and produce a human-readable summary.

Check out `cabal bench --benchmark-options --help` for more details.

# Network Testing

The benchmark can be also run over the running `demo` hydra-cluster, using `cabal bench` and produces a
`results.csv` file in a work directory. Same as for benchmarks results, you can use the `bench/plot.sh` script to plot the transaction confirmation times.

To run the benchmark inÂ this mode, the command is:
* `demo`: Runs a single _dataset_ freshly generated and collects its results in a markdown formatted file. The purpose of this setup is to facilitate a variaty of network-resiliance scenarios, such as packet loss or node failures. This is useful to prove the robustness and performance of the hydra-node's network over time and produce a human-readable summary.

For instance, we make use of this in our [CI](https://github.com/cardano-scaling/hydra/blob/master/.github/workflows/network-test.yaml) to keep track for scenarios that we care about.
