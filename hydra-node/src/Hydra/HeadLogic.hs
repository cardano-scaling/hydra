-- | Implements the Head Protocol's /state machine/ as a /pure function/.
--
-- The protocol is described in two parts in the [Hydra paper](https://iohk.io/en/research/library/papers/hydrafast-isomorphic-state-channels/)
--
--     * One part detailing how the Head deals with /client input/.
--     * Another part describing how the Head reacts to /network messages/ from peers.
--     * A third part detailing the /On-Chain Verification (OCV)/ protocol, i.e. the abstract "smart contracts" that are need to provide on-chain security.
--
-- This module is about the first two parts, while the "Hydra.Contract.Head" module in 'hydra-plutus' covers the third part.

-- | The main state of the Hydra protocol state machine. It holds both, the
-- overall protocol state, but also the off-chain 'CoordinatedHeadState'.
--
-- It is a recursive data structure, where 'previousRecoverableState' fields
-- record the state before the latest 'OnChainEvent' that has been observed.
-- On-Chain events are indeed only __eventually__ immutable and the application
-- state may be rolled back at any time (with a decreasing probability as the
-- time pass).
--
-- Thus, leverage functional immutable data-structure, we build a recursive
-- structure of states which we can easily navigate backwards when needed (see
-- 'Rollback' and 'rollback').
--
-- Note that currently, rolling back to a previous recoverable state eliminates
-- any off-chain events (e.g. transactions) that happened after that state. This
-- is particularly important for anything following the transition to
-- 'OpenState' since this is where clients may start submitting transactions. In
-- practice, clients should not send transactions right way but wait for a
-- certain grace period to minimize the risk.
