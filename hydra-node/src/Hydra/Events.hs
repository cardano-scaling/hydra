{-# LANGUAGE UndecidableInstances #-}

-- | This module defines the types and functions for creating 'EventSource' and
-- 'EventSink' instances and is intended to be used as an extension point.
--
-- A single 'EventSource' and zero or more 'EventSink' handles are used by the
-- main 'HydraNode' handle to load and send out events.
--
-- See 'Hydra.Events.FileBased' for an example implementation and
-- 'Hydra.Events.FileBasedSpec' for the corresponding test suite.
--
-- Custom implementations should be located under Hydra.Events to avoid
-- conflicts.
