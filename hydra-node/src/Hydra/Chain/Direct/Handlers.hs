-- * Posting Transactions

-- | A callback used to actually submit a transaction to the chain.
type SubmitTx m = ValidatedTx LedgerEra -> m ()

-- | Create a `Chain` component for posting "real" cardano transactions.
--
-- This component does not actually interact with a cardano-node, but creates
-- cardano transactions from `PostChainTx` transactions emitted by a
-- `HydraNode`, balancing them using given `TinyWallet`, while maintaining some
-- state in the `headState` variable and before handing it off to the given
-- 'SubmitTx' callback.
--
-- NOTE: Given the constraints on `m` this function should work within `IOSim` and does not
-- require any actual `IO`  to happen which makes it highly suitable for simulations and testing.
