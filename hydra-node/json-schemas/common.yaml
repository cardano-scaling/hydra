              **Note**: In the current version, all fees are paid using a specially "marked" UTxO that is expected to
              carry enough ADAs to pay for the Head protocol's advance and is consumed and produced upon each transaction.

          Initialising a new Head failed because the DirectChain component was unable to find
          a "seed" UTxO to consume. This can happen if no UTxO has been assigned to the internal wallet's address
          for this purpose, or if the component is still catching up with the chain.

          This error is usually transient and clients should retry to post the transaction.

          This can happen if no UTxO available to the internal wallet is

          Ensure that you have "seeded" the network using provided scripts and
          tools (see demo tutorial).
