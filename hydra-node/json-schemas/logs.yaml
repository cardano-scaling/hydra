title: Hydra Log API
description: >
  This schema documents the structure of the Log items produced by a Hydra node
  via its standard output stream. Items are emitted as individual JSON objects,
  separated by a newline which makes it easy to ingest by thirdparty tools and
  services.

          invalid in the future.
