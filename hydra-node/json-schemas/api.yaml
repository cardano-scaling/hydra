  version: '0.22.4'
  description: |
    WebSocket/HTTP API for administrating & interacting with Hydra Heads: multi-party isomorphic state-channels for Cardano.

    Once started, a Hydra node provides an API in the forms of JSON messages over WebSocket/HTTP endpoints. An Hydra node is an event-driven application where users (a.k.a you) are one possible source of inputs. Other sources can be mainly other Hydra nodes in the network, or transactions observed on the layer 1 (e.g. a closing transaction).
    Therefore, once connected, clients receive a stream of outputs as they arrive. Clients get to decide (using query parameters) if they want to observe the history of outputs and the transaction format.
    For example if client provides a path that looks like this `/?history=no&snapshot-utxo=no` the server will not serve prior history of server outputs, and the utxo field in the json will be omitted.

    They can interact with their node by pushing events to it, some are local, and some will have consequences on the rest of the head.

    See [the documentation](https://hydra.family/head-protocol/docs/dev/architecture#api) for more details on the overall API behavior.

    Init:
      title: Init
      description: |
        Initializes a new Head. This command is a no-op when a Head is already open and the server will output an `CommandFailed` message should this happen.

    Abort:
      title: Abort

        Aborts a head before it is opened. This can only be done before all participants have committed. Once opened, the head can't be aborted anymore but it can be closed using: `Close`.

    NewTx:

    Decommit:
      title: Decommit
      description: |
        Request to decommit a UTxO from a Head by providing a decommit tx. Upon reaching consensus, this
        will eventually result in corresponding transaction outputs becoming
        available on the layer 1.
      payload:
        $ref: "api.yaml#/components/schemas/Decommit"

    Close:
      title: Close
      description: |
        Terminate a head with the latest known snapshot. This effectively moves the head from the Open state to the Close state where the contestation phase begin. As a result of closing a head, no more transactions can be submitted via NewTx.
      payload:
        $ref: "api.yaml#/components/schemas/Close"

    Contest:
      title: Contest
      description: |
        Challenge the latest snapshot announced as a result of a head closure from another participant. Note that this necessarily contest with the latest snapshot known of your local Hydra node. Participants can only contest once.
      payload:
        $ref: "api.yaml#/components/schemas/Contest"

    Fanout:
      title: Fanout
      description: |
        Finalize a head after the contestation period passed. This will distribute the final (as closed and maybe contested) head state back on the layer 1.
      payload:
        $ref: "api.yaml#/components/schemas/Fanout"

    SideLoadSnapshot:
      title: SideLoadSnapshot
      description: |
        Request to adopt the provided confirmed snapshot, which must be enforceable and valid against the current protocol state on L1.
        The snapshot number and version must be equal to or greater than the previously known values and must be signed by all participants.
        Adopting a side-loaded snapshot is particularly useful when the head becomes stuck. It clears pending transactions in the local state, resets the local UTxO, and restarts the snapshot signing round by pruning the latest seen snapshot, which also resets the current leader.

        A Cardano transaction in the text envelope format . That is, a JSON
        object wrapper with some 'type' around a 'cborHex' encoded transaction.
        The hydra-node uses this format as follows:

          - When encoding, an additonal 'txId' is included.
          - On decoding, when 'txId' is included it is checked to be consistent.
          - The 'type' is not used to determine content and any transaction is
            tried to decode as a 'ConwayEra' transaction, which mostly is
            backward compatible to previous eras.
