  version: '0.7.0'
  description: |
    WebSocket API for administrating Hydra heads: multi-party isomorphic state-channels for Cardano.

    Once started, a Hydra node provides an API in the forms of JSON messages over WebSocket. An Hydra node is an event-driven application where users (a.k.a you) are one possible source of inputs. Other sources can be mainly other Hydra nodes in the network, or transactions observed on the layer 1 (e.g. a closing transaction).
    Therefore, once connected, clients receive events as a stream as they arrive. They can interact with their node by pushing events to it, some are local, and some will have consequences on the rest of the head.

    > By default, a Hydra node listens for TCP WebSocket connections on port `tcp/4001` . This can be changed using `--port`.
